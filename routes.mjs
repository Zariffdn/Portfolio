// Read by the route-html plugin in vite.config.mjs (one static shell per
// route with that page's title, description, canonical and Open Graph tags),
// by the browser sweep in tools/qa/sweep.mjs (which pages to open and which
// title each must end up with), and by src/contract.test.js, which checks this
// list against the rewrites in vercel.json, the <loc> entries in
// public/sitemap.xml and the <Route> paths in src/App.jsx. Adding a page means
// an entry here, a rewrite in vercel.json, a sitemap entry, a Route in App.jsx
// and meta.<titleKey> / meta.<descKey> in both locale files; the test names
// whichever one is missing.
//
// Fields:
//   name         short id used by `npm run qa -- --routes=` and in file names
//   path         the URL path; "/" is the home page (dist/index.html), every
//                other path is written to dist/<path>.html
//   titleKey     meta.<titleKey> in the locale files: the document title
//   descKey      meta.<descKey>: the meta description (160 characters at most)
//   type         og:type when it is not "website"
//   englishOnly  the page body stays in English in every language
//   image        Open Graph image under public/, with its alt text and size;
//                a route without one keeps the home page's /og/home.jpg
