                <p>
                  People often lock a backpack with a padlock, if they lock it
                  at all. Padlocks get broken, codes get forgotten, and nobody
                  tells you when someone is working at the lock. Once the bag
                  is gone there is no way to know where it went, and even with
                  a police report, getting it back can take a long time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A fingerprint lock fixes the forgotten code, but it fails
                  silently too. A stranger can keep trying the sensor and the
                  owner never finds out.

                <p>
                  So the goal was not just a better lock but a lock that
                  reports. A failed unlock attempt is not just rejected; it is
                  treated as a signal, and three failed matches make the bag
                  text its owner its GPS coordinates.

                <p>
                  The closest systems I reviewed either texted the owner about
                  a failed fingerprint but showed the bag&apos;s position only in
                  an Android app backed by cloud storage, or sent a GSM text
                  from a fingerprint-locked gate with no location at all. Mine
                  sends the coordinates in the SMS itself, so the alert reaches
                  the owner with no app, internet connection or server; only
                  looking the coordinates up in Google Maps needs data.

                  confirmed no-match; unreadable images do not count, and any
                  successful match clears the counter. My proposal slides said
                  five attempts; the final design and the build use three.

                  <strong>Three serial devices on one Uno.</strong> The
                  Uno&apos;s only hardware serial port is used for USB
                  debugging, so the fingerprint sensor, GSM modem and GPS all
                  run on SoftwareSerial. Only one of those can listen at a
                  time, so the alert routine takes turns: set up the modem,
                  read the GPS, send both texts, then restart the fingerprint

                  the planned app, which moved to future work. The cost is that
                  the owner copies the coordinates into Google Maps by hand, and
                  alerts only work on the local GSM network.

                  <strong>Raw AT commands.</strong> AT+CMGF=1 puts the modem in

                  (Ctrl+Z) sends the message.

                  <strong>Matching stays on the sensor.</strong> The AS608
                  stores the template and runs the search itself, so the Uno
                  only receives an ID and a confidence score.

                  I planned the build as a test-and-fix loop: install the Uno,
                  GSM, GPS and fingerprint sensor on one circuit, program them
                  in C++ and AT commands, test the fingerprint sensor, then test
                  SMS, going back to troubleshooting whenever something failed.

                <p>
                  My final report describes a working, battery-powered prototype
                  in which the fingerprint lock, failed-attempt alert and SMS
                  location work together. It records no accuracy, speed or
                  false-rejection figures, even for the GPS checks at three
                  places in Shah Alam, and that is the first thing I would
                  change.

                  Reading the sketch again as a working developer, these are
                  the issues I would raise in a code review.
                </p>
              </div>
              <ul className="cs-list text-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>No check for a real GPS fix.</strong> The isUpdated()
                  block is empty and nothing calls isValid(), so an alert could
                  carry 0.000000,0.000000 if no complete position was parsed.
                  The fix is to check the fix and its age, and send &quot;no
                  fix&quot; when there is not one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The modem runs blind.</strong> The code waits a fixed
                  second after each AT command and never reads the replies, so
                  a failed send (no signal, no credit) goes unnoticed and is
                  not retried.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The alert blocks the lock.</strong> The fixed delays in
                  the alert path add up to about 11 seconds with no scanning. A
                  millis()-based state machine would keep the lock responsive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The alert number is baked in.</strong> It is a
                  compile-time constant, so changing the owner&apos;s phone means
                  reflashing the board. It belongs in a setting the owner can
                  change.
