                  When feelings get heavy, words are often the first thing to
                  go. Silent Support asks for none: there is no text box. You
                  tap a feeling, read a few calm lines, and can open a
                  breathing screen from there.

                  notifications or gamification, and it is not a therapist or
                  a chatbot. Its core rule, named in the code, is presence over
                  intelligence: the written reply comes first, and the AI
                  never makes anyone wait.
